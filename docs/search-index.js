A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because the dollar can be invested and earn a day&#39;s worth of interest, making the total accumulate to a value more than a dollar by tomorrow.\nInterest can be compared to rent.[2] Just as rent is paid to a landlord by a tenant, without the ownership of the asset being transferred, interest is paid to a lender by a borrower who gains access to the money for a time before paying it back.\nBy letting the borrower have access to the money, the lender has sacrificed the exchange value of this money, and is compensated for it in the form of interest.\nThe initial amount of the borrowed funds (the present value) is less than the total amount of money paid to the lender.\nsee definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value",null,{"inputs":[{"name":"f64"},{"name":"f64"}],"output":{"name":"f64"}}],[5,"pi","","Profitability index (PI), also known as profit investment ratio (PIR) and value investment ratio (VIR), is the ratio of payoff to investment of a proposed project.\nIt is a useful tool for ranking projects because it allows you to quantify the amount of value created per unit of investment.\nsee definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profitability_index",null,null],[5,"roi","","Return on Investment (ROI) is the benefit to an investor resulting from an investment of some resource.\nA high ROI means the investment gains compare favorably to investment cost.\nAs a performance measure, ROI is used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the efficiency of a number of different investments.\nIn purely economic terms, it is one way of considering profits in relation to capital invested.\nsee definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment",null,{"inputs":[{"name":"f64"},{"name":"f64"}],"output":{"name":"f64"}}],[5,"lr","","In finance, leverage (sometimes referred to as gearing in the United Kingdom and Australia) is any technique involving the use of borrowed funds in the purchase of an asset, with the expectation that the after tax income from the asset and asset price appreciation will exceed the borrowing cost.\nNormally, the finance provider would set a limit on how much risk it is prepared to take and will set a limit on how much leverage it will permit, and would require the acquired asset to be provided as collateral security for the loan.\nsee definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)",null,{"inputs":[{"name":"f64"},{"name":"f64"},{"name":"f64"}],"output":{"name":"f64"}}],[5,"r72","","In finance, the rule of 72, the rule of 70 and the rule of 69.3 are methods for estimating an investment&#39;s doubling time.
